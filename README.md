# 🔍 VERIFAI — AI-Powered Misinformation Detection Platform

## 📌 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of digital media and generative AI has made misinformation more convincing and harder to detect. Fake news, AI-generated images, and manipulated content spread quickly across platforms, impacting **public trust, elections, financial decisions, and public safety**.

Most existing solutions are **fragmented**, focus on only one content type (text or image), and provide results without transparency—leaving users unsure *why* something is flagged as false or misleading.
